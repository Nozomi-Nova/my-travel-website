        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Nozomi Kaneda, a junior at Northeastern University majoring in Data Science and Business
            Administration with a concentration in Finance. I was born in Kobe, Japan, and moved to Morges, Switzerland,
            at the age of 3. My global upbringing has nurtured my passion for traveling. One of my most exciting trips
            was a cross-country journey from San Francisco to Chicago aboard the Amtrak Zephyr, which took 52 hours! It
            was an unforgettable experience traveling through breathtaking landscapes.</p>
